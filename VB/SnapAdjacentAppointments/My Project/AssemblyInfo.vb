' How to merge adjacent appointments together

' This example illustrates how to combine two adjacent appointments into one
' appointment by handling the XtraScheduler.AppointmentDrop event. Please drag the
' first appointment over the second one and drop it. As a result, the first
' appointment disappears and the second appointment's duration is increased.
